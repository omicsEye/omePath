\arguments{
\item{input_data}{It could be either 1) a score file which has at least a column for feature names and an column for scores, or 2) a omics profile which has rows as samples and columns as features}

\item{output}{output a directory path to where user wants resulst to be written}

\item{mapper_file}{a mapping file that has at least towcolumns one for pathways and one for features in each pathways in long format}

\item{pathway_col}{a column for pathways in the mapper_file}

\item{feature_col}{a column for features in the mapper_file}

\item{input_metadata}{a file or data frame that has metadata where score file in not provided and scores need to be calulated usig input_data, input_metadata, and meta}

\item{meta}{a couln name in input_metadata when score needs to be calculated an d score file is not provided (input_data is not a core file but a omics profile)}

\item{case_label}{a name for case group and is part of meta values.}

\item{control_label}{a name for control group and is part of meta values.}

\item{score_col}{a columnb name in input_data}

\item{pval_threshold}{a threshold for p-value which will be used to decide to visualize result for a pathway or not}

\item{fdr_threshold}{a threshold for fdr which will be used to decide to visualize result for a pathway or not}

\item{Pathway.Subject}{a pathway subject when HMDB database is provided as reference for metabolites (as omics features)}

\item{method}{a enrichment methods to be used, options are ks, gset, and wilcox}

\item{min_member}{a condition for a pathway to be analyzed as minimum number of a pathway members to be seen in the study}

\item{do_plot}{a TRUE or FALSE to plot result or not}
}
\value{
The result as a list  of 1) `enrichment_stats` a table for statistic of pathway enrichment, `rank_plots` a list of ggplots for density plot of enrichment base don rank of features, and 3) `score_plots` a list of ggplots for density plot of enrichment base don score of feature.
